The primary purpose of this change is to provide Void with a consistent naming
scheme for hook, and one for advices. Specifically, hooks. As a consequence of
this naming scheme, each advice I define advises exactly one function. Moreover,
having advise named in such a way makes getting the TARGET of an advice or hook
easy.

Also notable, this change added a system for adding advises and hooks that
expire. Specifically the functions for adding and.
