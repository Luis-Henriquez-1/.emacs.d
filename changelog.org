* using the package defhook

The purpose of this change is to extend and improve the functionality of
=defhook!= macro. Specifically, I introduce a consistent naming scheme for
user-designed hooks (incidentally with very concise syntax), logging system so I
can get output about when my custom hooks are called, and a rich.

A principle I want to strive to follow as a programmer is to reuse existing code
as much as possible. I had defined my own =defadvice!= macro. However, I found
code from someone who did the same thing but more thoroughly than me and with
additional features.
