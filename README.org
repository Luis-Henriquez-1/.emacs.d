This is an emacs configuration I have built over he course of over two year. The
reason I made this emacs configuration is to have a interfact to the computer
that is 100% customizable.

Note that I don't use a modeline because I find it consumes too much space and
is distracting. Maybe I'll use one if I figure out how to make it appear on the
frame instead of on each window.

* Principles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9bd8b2d0-a75d-4ebb-9b1a-ff2bfe495e7b
:END:

These are ideas I try to document things.

** Document Everything
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4f3ceddd-02fd-4ad2-9b3d-a2ea7340d742
:END:

I think that documentation in the form of docstrings and comments is
insufficient.

** Go Fast
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bce101e5-4da5-4799-ba2e-14149c45cd5c
:END:

I try. While my startup time is relatively fast compared to other emacs configs,
I have not yet implemented.

** Robust
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       df0b966f-5b4d-4ce1-8b2c-48a0668fcd5e
:END:

** Utilize existing functionality
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       134cd32b-1933-4fac-8032-aa4ffbf2c617
:END:

In general, I try to use existing packages instead of doing things from scratch myself.

* Features
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c558d974-0742-4675-96ab-83150feb9536
:END:

** next-level documentation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       43baa970-dc10-4887-8819-e5cb48ae198e
:END:

I document everything with.

** advanced lazy-loading
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5c437948-5eb6-45b1-a874-2f07c463450a
:END:

I load packages just before function calls, I.

** naming convention
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bebcb469-c345-47a3-bd79-d005df80fc63
:END:

** no anonymous functions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8f33347e-6d9f-4b90-8a73-d438843341e7
:END:

Every function that's in a hook or that's used for advice should be named based
on its purpose. Doing this makes it easy to know what a hook or advice does at a
glance and also allows for easy removal/modification of a hook or advice.

** every function should have a docstring
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       dde32cf8-7c32-48d4-ba94-382b8bb51fc6
:END:

** use-package with many custom keywords
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       963e4f05-10aa-4e31-9e9c-b715e904ba63
:END:

** idle feature loading with =idle-require=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a79acdb0-5272-4316-bb11-553a36aa5df1
:END:

** optional system dependency management via system-packages
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f60d4c21-30fd-42b0-9b86-d1013909f6a8
:END:

* Future Goals
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       16f35872-4347-439e-a90a-cc50ca21ef97
:END:

These are things I plan to do in the future.

** optimize package loading during compilation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       92dca801-0261-43b5-b64f-5a3636886da8
:END:

** module like dynamic tangling of headlines
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       98a39ba4-97ca-4324-8433-322cf9c29137
:END:

** dynamic bindings
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       992c3678-8788-4f1e-b355-dab53cb7b9b3
:END:
